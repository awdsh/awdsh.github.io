        "abstract": "Delay-Tolerant Networks exhibit highly asynchronous connections often routed over many mobile hops before reaching its intended destination. The Bundle Security Protocol has been standardized providing properties such as authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of bundles using traditional Public-Key Cryptography. Other protocols based on Identity-Based Cryptography have been proposed to reduce the key distribution overhead. However, in both schemes, secret keys are usually valid for several months. Thus, a secret key extracted from a compromised node allows for decryption of past communications since its creation. We solve this problem and propose the first forward secure protocol for Delay-Tolerant Networking. For this, we apply the Puncturable Encryption construction designed by Green and Miers, integrate it into the Bundle Security Protocol and adapt its parameters for different highly asynchronous scenarios. Finally, we provide performance measurements and discuss their impact.",

We propose new latency aware collaborative cognitive caching approach suitable for content dissemination and query in heterogeneous opportunistic mobile networks and dynamic workloads.

        "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly becoming more common and ownership is set to rise globally in coming years. The potential impacts of increased EVs on the electrical grid have been widely investigated and in its current state, existing grid infrastructure will struggle to meet the high demands at peak charging hours. The limited range of electric cars compounds this issue. We therefore propose CognitiveCharge, a novel approach to predictive and adaptive disconnection aware opportunistic energy discovery and transfer for the smart vehicular charging. CognitiveCharge detects and reacts to individual nodes and network regions which are at risk of getting depleted by using implicit predictive hybrid contact and resources congestion heuristics. CognitiveCharge exploits localised relative utility based approach to adaptively offload the energy from parts of the network with energy surplus to depleting areas with non-uniform depletion rates. We evaluate CognitiveCharge using a multi-day traces for the city of San Francisco, USA and Nottingham, UK to compare against existing infrastructure across a range of metrics. CognitiveCharge successfully eliminates congestion at both ad hoc and infrastructure charging points, reduces the time that a vehicle must wait to charge from the point at which it identifies as being in need of energy, and drastically reduces the total number of nodes in need of energy over the evaluation period.",

        "abstract": "Detecting and dealing with congestion in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) is an important and challenging problem. Current DTN forwarding algorithms typically direct traffic towards more central nodes in order to maximise delivery ratios and minimise delays, but as traffic demands increase these nodes may become saturated and unusable. We propose CafRep, an adaptive congestion aware protocol that detects and reacts to congested nodes and congested parts of the network by using implicit hybrid contact and resources congestion heuristics. CafRep exploits localised relative utility based approach to offload the traffic from more to less congested parts of the network, and to replicate at adaptively lower rate in different parts of the network with non-uniform congestion levels. We extensively evaluate our work against benchmark and competitive protocols across a range of metrics over three real connectivity and GPS traces such as Sassy [44], San Francisco Cabs [45] and Infocom 2006 [33]. We show that CafRep performs well, independent of network connectivity and mobility patterns, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DTN forwarding algorithms in the face of increasing rates of congestion. CafRep maintains higher availability and success ratios while keeping low delays, packet loss rates and delivery cost. We test CafRep in the presence of two application scenarios, with fixed rate traffic and with real world Facebook application traffic demands, showing that regardless of the type of traffic CafRep aims to deliver, it reduces congestion and improves forwarding performance.",
